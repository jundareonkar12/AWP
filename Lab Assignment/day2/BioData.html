                <h3>Personal Info:</h3>   
                        First, you are typically expected to provide a window into your personal 
                        motivations, offer a summary of your field, your research, or your background,
                        set some long-term goals, and note specific interest in the program to which 
                        you are applying.
                        n the pdf link below, the first two one-page statements written by 
                        students in the geological sciences are interesting to compare to each 
                        other. Despite their different areas of research specialization within the
                        same field, both writers demonstrate a good deal of scientific fluency and 
                        kinship with their target programs.
                        Second, you are expected to provide some personal detail and to 
                        communicate effectively and efficiently. Failure to do so can greatly
                        limit your chances of acceptance.</p>

                    <h3>Family background</h3>
                        Where family background is concerned, the determinants found to be of 
                        importance for academic achievement have also been considered with respect to
                         dropout (e.g., Rumberger 1983, Rumberger and Thomas 2000). Parents' level of 
                        education represents a potential predictor of dropout, that is, better educated 
                         parents spend more time with their children, thus supporting their accomplishments
                         and increasing the likelihood that they will remain in school. Furthermore, these 
                         parents influence the academic performance of their children by imparting the values,
                         aspirations, and motivation needed to succeed and remain in school. With regard to parental
                        income, children from poor families probably feel more pressure to contribute to 
                        the family income, and thus leave school to seek work at an earlier stage. Family 
                         structures are also important, in that children from broken homes where one or both
                        parents are absent are less likely to receive the support and encouragement needed 
                        to stay in school. The absence of parents, however, is often combined with financial 
                        problems that might explain the dropout. In a more detailed analysis of family 
                         influences, Rumberger et al. (1990) investigated the interaction styles between 
                        parents and children and the consequences for dropout. Dropouts were more likely
                        to live in households characterized by a

                            The beginning lets your readers know what the essay is about, the topic.
                            he essay's topic does not exist in a vacuum, however; part of letting 
                            readers know what your essay is about means establishing the essay's context,
                            the frame within which you will approach your topic. For instance, in an 
                            essay about the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech, the context
                            may be a particular legal theory about the speech right; it may be historical
                            information concerning the writing of the amendment; it may be a contemporary 
                            dispute over flag burning; or it may be a question raised by the text itself.
                            The point here is that, in establishing the essay's context, you are also 
                            limiting your topic. That is, you are framing an approach to your topic that
                            necessarily eliminates other approaches. Thus, when you determine your
                            context, you simultaneously narrow your topic and take a big step toward
                            focusing your essay. Here's an example.

                            When Kate Chopin's novel The Awakening was published in 1899, critics 
                            condemned the book as immoral. One typical critic, writing in the Providence 
                            Journal, feared that the novel might "fall into the hands of youth, leading
                            them to dwell on things that only matured persons can understand, and promoting 
                            unholy imaginations and unclean desires" (150). A reviewer in the St. Louis Post- 
                            Dispatch wrote that "there is much that is very improper in it, not to say
                             positively unseemly."

                            Further analysis of Memorial Hall, and of the archival sources that describe the
                            process of building it, suggests that the past may not be the central subject of the 
                            hall but only a medium. What message, then, does the building convey, and why are the 
                            fallen soldiers of such importance to the alumni who
                            built it? Part of the answer, it seems, is that Memorial Hall is an educational tool, an 
                            attempt by the Harvard community of the 1870s to influence the future by shaping our memory 
                            of their times. The commemoration of those students and graduates who died for the Union
                            during the Civil War is one aspect of this alumni message to the future, but it may not be 
                            the central idea.
                            The fullness of your idea will not emerge until your conclusion, but your beginning must 
                            clearly indicate the direction your idea will take, must set your essay on that road. And 
                            whether you focus your essay by posing a question, stating a thesis, or combining these approaches,
                            by the end of your beginning, readers should know what you're writing about, and whyâ€”and why they 
                            might want to read on.
